Open LLMs
=========

The ``prompting`` and ``zero_shot`` methods generate paraphrases with an
open general-purpose language model that runs locally.

Prompting
---------

The ``prompting`` method generates paraphrases by sending input texts to a
local HuggingFace causal language model with a prompt template. The default
model is `SmolLM3-3B <https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B>`_
using insights from `The Synthetic Data Playbook <https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/finephrase>`_.

.. code-block:: python

   results = diversify("The cat sat on the mat.", method="prompting")

**Choosing a model.** Any HuggingFace causal LM can be used. Pass the model
identifier directly to :func:`~diversify_text.diversify`:

.. code-block:: python

   results = diversify(
       "The cat sat on the mat.",
       method="prompting",
       model="Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507",
   )

or to the method constructor:

.. code-block:: python

   from diversify_text import Diversifier
   from diversify_text.method.prompting import PromptingMethod

   method = PromptingMethod(model="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3")
   results = Diversifier(method=method).diversify("The cat sat on the mat.")

``model`` works for the ``prompting`` and ``zero_shot`` methods; the
``tinystyler`` method has a fixed model, so passing ``model`` with it
raises an error. See :ref:`which-model` below for insights into which models to use based on our practical experience.

Instruct-tuned models are recommended. Chat templates are applied automatically
when the tokenizer provides one.

.. note::

   Thinking/reasoning models (e.g. SmolLM3-3B) are detected automatically and
   have their thinking mode turned off (``enable_thinking=False``) during
   generation. Thinking tokens add overhead without improving paraphrase
   quality in this setting.

**Inference backend.** The method currently uses the ``transformers`` library
for inference.

.. note::

   `vLLM <https://vllm.ai/>`_ support, batched inference, and streaming from
   large files are planned for a future release.

**Prompt templates.** All templates are example-based style transfer prompts:
the target style is demonstrated through example texts inserted into the
prompt; prompts without style examples are intentionally not supported. The
default template is ``style_transfer``; ``humanize_transfer`` (inspired by
`Zhang et al. (2024) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05952>`_) additionally
instructs the model to imitate human imperfections found in the style
examples. Select a template — or pass your own — via the ``prompt`` option:

.. code-block:: python

   results = diversify(
       "The experiment was conducted in a controlled lab setting.",
       method="prompting",
       method_kwargs={"prompt": "humanize_transfer"},
   )

A custom template must contain both the ``[DOCUMENT SEGMENT]`` and
``[STYLE EXAMPLES]`` placeholders (``[STYLE NAME]`` is optional):

.. code-block:: python

   my_prompt = (
       "Study these examples:\n[STYLE EXAMPLES]\n"
       "Rewrite the following text in the same style. "
       "Text: [DOCUMENT SEGMENT]"
   )

   results = diversify(
       "The cat sat on the mat.",
       method="prompting",
       method_kwargs={"prompt": my_prompt},
   )

**Style examples.** The prompting method uses the default style bank,
loaded from ``stylebank.json``: styles organized in a
language-variation taxonomy — individual styles (idiolects) and
group-level variation across time (diachronic), region (diatopic),
social group (diastratic), register (diaphasic), and medium
(diamesic).  See :data:`diversify_text.styles.DEFAULT_STYLE_BANK` and
the :doc:`styles` page.  Select styles with the top-level ``styles``
parameter (or pass your own via ``style_texts``):

.. code-block:: python

   results = diversify(
       "The experiment was conducted in a controlled lab setting.",
       method="prompting",
       styles=["informational"],
   )

Zero-shot
---------

The ``zero_shot`` method defines each style by a rewrite *instruction*
instead of example texts, and sends one instruction per style to a
causal language model (same default model and options — ``model``,
``precision`` — as the prompting method).

Its own style bank maps style names to instructions
(``ZeroShotMethod.style_bank``:
``formal``, ``simple``, ``complex``, ``caps``, ``lowercase``, and
more), so ``styles`` and ``n`` select from these:

.. code-block:: python

   results = diversify(
       "The experiment was conducted in a controlled lab setting.",
       method="zero_shot",
       styles=["formal", "caps"],
   )

With this method, ``style_texts`` are instructions — exactly one per
style. An instruction can place the input text itself with
``[DOCUMENT SEGMENT]``; otherwise the text is appended at the end:

.. code-block:: python

   results = diversify(
       "The experiment was conducted in a controlled lab setting.",
       method="zero_shot",
       style_texts={"pirate": ["Rewrite the text as an old-timey pirate would say it."]},
   )

.. _which-model:

Which model?
------------

.. note::

    These notes are based on manually trying the models on a small set of sentences and styles, not a systematic evaluation.
    We tried well-known small models up to 5B, following the insight from [The Synthetic Data Playbook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/finephrase) that small models are effective at paraphrasing tasks.
    Which model works best can change with your texts, styles, and hardware.

     - 3B
     - The **default** because fastest. Quality ok-ish. Tends to add info that is not in the input. Sometimes starts replies with "Here\'s a paraphrased version of the document in the same style as the examples provided:"
   * - `Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512 <https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512>`_
     - 3B
     - Outputs often contain commentary
       and formatting ("Here's a paraphrase: ..."). Not recommended.
   * - `Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 <https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507>`_
     - 4B
     - Best 4B. Mostly faithful to the input and concise.
   * - `Qwen3.5-4B <https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B>`_
     - 4B
     - Similar to Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507. Occasionally repeats an
       emoji many times.
   * - `gemma-4-E2B-it <https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-E2B-it>`_
     - 5B
     - Best 5B. Best of tested **overall**. The most natural-sounding outputs. Some emoji repetitions happening though.

Generation speed depends mostly on model size: producing a token
requires reading all model weights from memory once, so on the same
machine, expect speed to scale roughly with one over the parameter
count.

Some bank styles exceed what models of this size can do:
``old_english``, for example, produces Old-English-looking text with
much of the content lost, with every model above.

Example outputs

Outputs are shown as generated. For dialect styles we can not judge
how authentic the outputs are — the examples only show how differently
the models behave.
