The **StyleBank** is a curated and structured collection of English texts gathered from multiple sources. It was developed in two phases. First, we devised a taxonomy of linguistic variation by drawing inspiration from previous theoretical work in this area. Second, we used this taxonomy to populate the StyleBank, identifying suitable corpora from prior work for each leaf category in the taxonomy.

## Taxonomy

To develop the taxonomy, we drew inspiration from influential work in sociolinguistics and linguistic variation. Based on this literature, we organized our taxonomy into four hierarchical levels.

At the highest level, the taxonomy distinguishes *Language variation* into *Individual* and *Intra-group* variations, corresponding respectively to variation associated with a specific speaker and variation shared by a community of speakers. The next level contains the principal dimensions of variation. Individual variation is represented by *Idiolect*, referring to linguistic characteristics associated with a particular individual. Intra-group variation is subdivided into *Diachronic* (variation across time), *Diatopic* (variation across geographical regions), *Diastratic* (variation across social groups), *Diaphasic* (variation across genres and registers), and *Diamesic* (variation across communication modalities).

Each of these dimensions is further refined into increasingly specific categories, culminating in a set of 85 leaf nodes that correspond to concrete linguistic varieties.

## Data

The 85 leaf nodes of the taxonomy form the basis of the text collection included in the StyleBank. Their inclusion was guided by the availability of suitable corpora corresponding to each category. To populate the StyleBank, we collected texts from the corpora listed in the table below.

Each leaf node is populated with between 10 and 64 texts (mean: 42 texts per leaf). In total, the StyleBank contains 3,609 texts. All texts in the StyleBank are between 4 and 47k words in length (mean: 54 words). When passed to a model, each text is cut after its first 500 words (see `max_len_style_text`); the StyleBank itself keeps the full texts. We manually checked all texts to assess their quality.
