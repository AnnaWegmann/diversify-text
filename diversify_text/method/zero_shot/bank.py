"""Instruction bank for the zero_shot method.

Each entry is one style, defined by a single rewrite instruction for
the causal language model (instead of example texts).  An instruction
may place the input text itself via the ``[DOCUMENT SEGMENT]``
placeholder; otherwise the text is appended at the end during
generation.
